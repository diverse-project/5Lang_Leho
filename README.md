# Language Extension Header and Options

$L^{EHO}$ is a specialisation of [$GPFL$](https://github.com/diverse-project/5Lang_GPFL/tree/67140a90ba70a2b6b9d66454a4ccca9c28460c9f). It enables the definition of policies solely based on the values of particular IPv6 fields. It has been speciffcaly made to write filtering policies according to [RFC9288](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9288) named "Recommendations on the Filtering of IPv6 Packets Containing IPv6 Extension Headers at Transit Routers".

To see a default policy written in $L^{EHO}$, please report to the [example](./example/IPv6-RFC9288/).
